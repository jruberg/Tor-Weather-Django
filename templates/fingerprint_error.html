<h3>Error: Fingerprint not found</h3>
<br>
<p>
We could not locate a Tor node with fingerprint {{ fingerprint }}.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Here are some potential problems: 
<ul>
<li> The fingerprint was entered incorrectly </li> 
<li> The node with the given fingerprint was set up within the last hour, 
in which case you should try to register again a bit later </li>
<li> The node with the given fingerprint has been down for over a year </li>
<li> The node you are trying to monitor is running on an out of date
verion of Tor (version 0.1.0.5 or earlier) and doesn't publish its 
fingerprint to the directory authorities.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
