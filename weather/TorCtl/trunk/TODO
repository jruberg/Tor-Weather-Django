- The inline documentation generally needs lots more work.  Some of it
  implicitly assumes that the user has read "control-spec.txt".

- We need to explain step-by-step how to achieve all of the things we want
  people to do on the contest, especially how to launch Tor securely.

- There should be functions to get and parse the fancier values from get-info

- A C library would be cool, but there are obstacles.  (These are annoying,
  not impossible.)

    - Cross-platform issues.  Not everybody handles sockets the same way, and
      that sucks.  Also, you can't count on a decent threads implementation.

    - Async issues.  To receive asynchronous events from Tor, the controller
      can't just follow a simple write-command/read-reply strategy.  It needs
      to either:

        - have a separate thread read asynchronously
        - muck with select/poll/epoll/kpoll/libevent.
        - force the developer to muck with threads or asynchonous IO

   - Once you've solved the two problems above, you have another hurdle if
     you want your library to be embedded in other languages: You want to
     play nice with whatever solution those languages use for the above
     problems, while still playing nicely with C.
