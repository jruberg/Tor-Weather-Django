Hello and welcome to Tor!

We've noticed that your Tor node has been running long enough to be
flagged as "stable". First, we would like to thank you for your 
contribution to the Tor network! As Tor grows, we require ever more 
nodes to optomize browsing speed and reliability for our users. Your 
node is helping to serve the millions of Tor clients out there.

As a node operator, you may be interested in the Tor Weather service,
which sends important email notifications when a node is down or 
your version is out of date. We here at Tor consider this service to
be vitally important and greatly useful to all node operators. If you're 
interested in Tor Weather, please visit the following link to register:
 
https://weather.torproject.org/

You might also be interested in the or-announce mailing list, which is
a low volume list for announcements of new releases and critical 
security updates. To join, send an e-mail message to majordomo@seul.org
with no subject and a body of "subscribe or-announce". 

Thank you again for your contribution to the Tor network! We won't send
you any further emails unless you subscribe.

sincerely apologize and promise never to email you again!
